# Google Summer of Code 2024 Journey and Learnings

## Little Bit About Me
Hello Everyone, I'm [Atharva Shirdhankar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/atharvashirdhankar/), an Open Source Developer and DevOps Engineer with a strong passion for Linux Systems, Docker, and GitHub Actions. I also enjoy working with a variety of GenAI frameworks and platforms like TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Hugging Face.

My coding expertise spans Bash scripting, Python, R, and Go, which I use to optimize workflows and enhance development processes. Additionally, I love experimenting with microcontrollers and IoT, particularly with the Raspberry Pi boards, where I bring together hardware and software to create exciting projects.

## How it started

My journey in Open Source and GSoC began in 2023 when I first discovered the [R Dev Container project](https://github.com/StarTrooper08/GSoC_Learnings). That year, I was thrilled to be selected as a GSoC'23 mentee. Even after the official program ended, I continued to contribute to the project, gradually adding to its development.

Fast forward to March 17, 2024, when the R Dev Container project was once again listed on the R Project GSoC Idea list. At that moment, I faced a dilemma: should I participate as a mentee for the second time or step up as a co-mentor? Ultimately, I decided to embrace the unique opportunity GSoC offers by allowing individuals to participate as mentees twice.

Following the same process I did in GSoC'23, I carefully reviewed the [project description](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2024/wiki/Enhancing-the-R-Dev-Container) and the [project test case tasks](https://github.com/StarTrooper08/r-dev-env-test) outlined for the R Dev Container. I completed the tasks, engaged in meaningful discussions with mentors, prepared my project proposal, and then waited patiently for the results—just as I had done the year before.

And that’s how my Open Source journey truly began!

## Project Background

In order to encourage users to contribute to R, it is important to lower the on-ramp to contribution so that people are not frustrated by set-up issues and that they feel that the time volunteered is being spent on useful work. A common challenge is getting a development environment set up with all the prerequisites and configurations to build R from source. Difficulties can be caused by different operating systems, ways of managing software on those systems and interactions with personal set-ups. The R Dev Container provides a standardized environment that can be accessed through a web browser meaning that a contributor can get started with building R in less than an hour, rather than spending several hours finding out how to set up their own machine.

### Community Collaboration and Participation

Beyond collaborating with my mentors during GSoC, I had the opportunity to present the project to other R Project members during the RCWG meeting, which is the monthly gathering of R contributors. The R Dev Container received positive feedback from the community—many members found it helpful, provided valuable suggestions for improvement, and even contributed directly to the project.

One of the highlights was seeing the R Dev Container in action during R Dev Day in July 2024, where developers used it to contribute to the R codebase. An excellent example of its practical application is showcased in a blog post by Di Cook, which you can find [here](https://www.dicook.org/posts/2024-07-14-r-devel/).

I am grateful to my mentors Heather Turner and Iain Emsley for encouraging me to participate in the LatinR event and for guiding me through the process of reviewing my talk abstract. This will be my first time presenting at a large community event organized by the R Project, and I am excited about the opportunity.

A special thanks to Di Cook, Elio Campitelli, and Lorena Abad Crespo for their invaluable contributions to the R Dev Container project.
