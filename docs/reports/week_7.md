# Week 7
July 8 - July 13


## Testing Current Environment

This week, I dedicated time to thoroughly testing the current build project to ensure stability and performance. This was an essential step before transitioning to setting up Gitpod for the R Dev Container. Testing involved verifying the integrity of existing features and ensuring that all components were functioning correctly. Once confident in the current build, I proceeded with configuring the Gitpod environment, which will enable a more streamlined development experience and facilitate easier collaboration.
