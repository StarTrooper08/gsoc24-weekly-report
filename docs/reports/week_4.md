## which_r version R version choice validation

While working on the set_build_r issue, I initially overlooked the importance of testing and validating R version choices in the which_r script. I later rectified this by implementing a choice validation mechanism within the which_r script, ensuring users can seamlessly switch between different R versions in the R Dev Container. Special thanks to my mentor, Iain Emsley, for his valuable assistance in testing and refining this addition to the project.

**which_r helper script**

The which_r script is designed to help users switch between different R versions available in the R Dev Container. It allows the user to select the R version they want to use in new R terminals. This script lists all the available R builds in the container and updates the VS Code settings to point to the selected R version.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Specify the parent directory
parent_dir="/workspaces/r-dev-env/build"  # need to change to dynamic afterwards //TODO

# Path to the settings.json file
settings_file_path="/home/vscode/.vscode-remote/data/Machine/settings.json"

# Ask user which R version to use
echo "Which version of R should be used in new R terminals?"
echo "  1. R 4.4.0 (release version built into this container)"

# Check for additional R versions in subdirectories
if [ -d "$parent_dir" ]; then
  # Create an array to store subdirectory names
  subdirs=()
  
  # Loop through subdirectories and print numbered list
  counter=2  # Start counter at 2 to avoid conflict with built-in R
  for dir in "$parent_dir"/*; do
    if [ -d "$dir/bin" ] && [ -x "$dir/bin/R" ]; then
      subdir=$(basename "$dir")
      subdirs+=("$subdir")  # Populate subdirs array
      echo "  $counter. $subdir"
      ((counter++))
    fi
  done
  
  # If no additional R builds were found
  if [ ${#subdirs[@]} -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "No additional R builds available."
  fi
fi

# If no additional R builds were found
if [ ${#subdirs[@]} -eq 0 ]; then
  range=1
  echo "No additional R builds available."
else
  range=$((counter - 1))
fi

# Get user choice
read -p "Enter the number corresponding to the selected version: " choice

# Define selected version based on choice
if [[ "$choice" -eq 1 ]]; then
  # Use built-in R
  selected_version="/usr/bin/R"
elif [[ "$choice" -ge 2 ]] && [[ "$choice" -lt "$counter" ]]; then
  # Use R from chosen subdirectory
  chosen_subdir="${subdirs[((choice - 2))]}"  
  selected_version="$parent_dir/$chosen_subdir/bin/R"
else
  # Invalid choice, default to built-in R
  if [[ $range -eq 1 ]]; then
    echo "Invalid choice, please enter 1. Defaulting to built-in R version."
  else
    echo "Invalid choice, please select options between 1 to $range. Defaulting to built-in R version."
  fi
  selected_version="/usr/bin/R"
fi

# Update settings.json with the chosen R path
updated_settings_data=$(cat "$settings_file_path" | jq --arg subdir "$selected_version" '."r.rterm.linux"=$subdir')
echo "$updated_settings_data" > "$settings_file_path"

echo "R terminal will now use version: $selected_version"
```

**Explanation:**

- Directory and File Paths: The script specifies a directory where R builds are stored and the path to the VS Code settings file that will be updated.
- User Prompt: It prompts the user to select which R version to use, listing the built-in R version first.
- Checking for R Builds: The script searches the specified directory for additional R builds and lists them as options if found.
- User Input Handling: Based on the userâ€™s choice, the script sets the selected R version. If an invalid choice is made, it defaults to the built-in R version.
- Updating VS Code: The script updates the VS Code settings file with the selected R version so that new terminals use the correct version.
- Confirmation: It then confirms which R version will be used in new R terminals.

## Use function vs script for set_build_r

In this issue, the set_build_R script was encountering permission issues, which prevented it from functioning properly. To resolve this, the script was added to .bashrc, and it was restructured into a function to make it more readable and maintainable.
